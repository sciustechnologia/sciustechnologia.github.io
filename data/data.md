## Last project related to programming and data analysis: 
- Use Python and SQL together to perform data analysis, and build data-driven applications.

Breakdown of the essential skills: 

## Python Skills:

### Basic Python Programming:
- [x] Understanding of Python syntax and basic constructs (variables, loops, functions, etc.).
- [x] Familiarity with data structures like lists, dictionaries, and tuples.

### Libraries for Database Interaction:
- [x] SQLite: sqlite3 module.
- [x] MySQL: mysql-connector-python or PyMySQL.
- [ ] PostgreSQL: psycopg2.
- [ ] SQLAlchemy: An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) for Python.

### Data Manipulation and Analysis:
- [x] Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- [x] NumPy: For numerical operations.
- [x] Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.

### File Handling:
- [x] Reading from and writing to CSV, Excel, and other file formats.

### Exception Handling:
- [x] Managing exceptions and errors that occur during database operations.

## SQL Skills:

### Basic SQL Commands:
- [x] SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE.
- [x] CREATE, ALTER, DROP tables.

### Advanced SQL Queries:
- [ ] Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL).
- [ ] Subqueries and nested queries.
- [x] Aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.).
- [x] Grouping and sorting results.

### Database Design:
- [ ] Normalization and database schema design.
- [x] Understanding primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes.

### Transaction Management:
- [ ] BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK.

### Stored Procedures and Functions:
- [80%] Creating and using stored procedures and user-defined functions.

--

## Integrating Python with SQL:

### Connecting to a Database:
- [x] Establishing a connection to the database from Python.
- [x] Understanding connection parameters (host, port, database name, user, password).

### Executing SQL Queries from Python:
- [x] Using cursor objects to execute SQL commands.
- [x] Fetching results from executed queries (e.g., fetchone(), fetchall()).

### Data Insertion and Retrieval:
- [x] Inserting data into tables from Python.
- [x] Retrieving and processing data within Python.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation:
- [x] Cleaning and transforming data before inserting it into the database.
- [70%] Using Python for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.

### Automating Database Tasks:
- [ ] Automating routine database tasks and maintenance using Python scripts.

--

## Practical Application:

### Building a Sample Project:
- [x] Combining Python and SQL skills to build a sample project, such as a simple web application, data analysis tool, or a data pipeline. (so far 1 project: EV market in Germany and the US)

### Debugging and Optimization:
- [%50] Debugging database connectivity issues.
- [ ] Optimizing SQL queries for better performance.

## Example Workflow:

- [x] Connect to Database:

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()
```

- [x] Create a Table:

```python
cursor.execute('''
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employees (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    salary REAL
)
''')
conn.commit()
```

- [x] Insert Data:

```python
cursor.execute('''
INSERT INTO employees (name, salary) VALUES (?, ?)
''', ("John Doe", 60000))
conn.commit()
```

- [x] Fetch Data:

```python
cursor.execute('SELECT * FROM employees')
rows = cursor.fetchall()
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

- [x] Close Connection:

```python
    conn.close()
```

**My Guideline**
I use in my Playbooks, Handbooks, and Userguides following perspectives as guidelines:
- the logical sequence to get things done.
- the step-by-step approach that allows any user to accomplish goals.
- readability, readability, readability!
