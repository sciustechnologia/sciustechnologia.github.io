### pandas - function

### Arithmetic Methods

|       | desciption |
|---    |---    |
|  df.sum()     | sum of dataframe |
|  df.prod() |  produt of all values in a dataframe     |
| def.max()/df.min()  | max, min, of values in a dataframe |

### Statistical Methods

|       | desciption |
|---    |---    |
|  df.mean()     | mean of dataframe |
|  df.median() |  median of dataframe     |
| def.std()  | standard deviation of a dataframe |
| def.var()  | variance of a dataframe |

### Grouping

* pandas has facilities for analysis of data by groups
* Can apply various aggregate, statistical and custom functions on groups
* Can put the results back into one Series of DataFrame
* Examples: group and apply functions by country, by class, by industry, etc.

### Plotting

* matplotlib s integrated into pandas
* Graphs can appear inline in Jupyter notebook/lab

### Importing/Exporting to/from a DataFrame

* CSV file
* Excel
* JSON
* SQL
* HTML (only importing)

### pi Launcher

- use jupyter for this
  
```python 
# read CSV file into a dataframe
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('Billionare.csv')
df
# Output is a table

print(df.info())
# Output is all the details like datatypes and so on

# select column
df.Name
df.NetWorth
# Jupyter hit enter and it shows them

# select row
# Jupyter hit enter and it shows them
df.loc[9]

# display/select multiple columns
# Jupyter hit enter and it shows them
df[['Rank', 'Name', 'Networth']]

# filter Billionares in the US
df[df.Country == "United States"]

# filter Billionares in Tech who are under 33 yo.
df.loc[(df.Country =="United States") & (df.Industry == "Technology") & (df.Age < 33)]

# filter Billionares by Country
df.groupby("Country")["Name"].count()

# filter Billionares by Country and Industry
df.groupby(["Country", "Industry"])["Name"].count()

df.groupby("Industry")["Networth"].mean()
# => TypeErrors (Networth column is a string type)
# so it won't work with the mean method

# add an new column called networth(all lower case) that is a float of the NetWorth Column
df['networth'] = df.NetWorth.replace(r'\$([\d.]+) B',r'\1', regex=True)
df.networth = df.networth.astype(float)
df.networth[:10]
df.networth.mean()
df.groupby(["Industry"])["networth"].mean()
```



### select - multiple columns

```python 
```

### filter Billionaires in the United States

```python 
```

### filter Billionaires in the Technology industry who are under…

```python 
```

### Billionaires by Country and by Industry

```python 
```

### Add a new column called networth (all lowercase) that is a…

```python 
df['networth']=df.Networth.replace(r'\$([\d.]+) B', r'\1, regex=True)
df.networth=df.networth.astype(float)
df.networth[:10]
df.networth.mean()
df.groupby(["Industry"])["networth"].mean()
```
