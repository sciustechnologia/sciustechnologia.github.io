## TCL (Tool Command Language) 
*  was more prevalent in the past, particularly for controlling Automated Test Equipment (ATE) used in chip manufacturing. 
* It's still used in some legacy systems or specific ATE environments. 
* Python for audio testing scripting with libraries like NumPy, SciPy, and Librosa


**Important Considerations:**

*   **ATE Documentation is Essential:**  You absolutely *must* have the documentation for your ATE system to understand the available TCL commands and their syntax.
*   **Error Checking:** Implement robust error checking in your scripts to handle potential communication errors or test failures.
*   **Modular Design:** Break your scripts into smaller, reusable procedures to improve readability and maintainability.

### TCL scripting in audio testing is used for 
*  automating ATE equipment, 
* controlling test flow, and 
* collecting data.
