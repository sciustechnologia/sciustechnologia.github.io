## My  audio testing experience

> In my project I covered audio testing mostly on the system level, with here and there a bit deeper.

### With Google Assitant 

I did recording of the voice commands based on a script that was triggered through the terminal, 
and gathered data into a file, back to the laptop.
* I created the test cases, 
* validated and optimaized the script, 
* ran the tests, 
*  collected the data. 
*  Afterwards we used Audacity to convert the files, cut the files and or combined the files.

1. For some features we had to test if the audio works when multiple device were interconnected.
2. This involved infotainment system.

### On Alexa
* mostly prototypes or close to final product validation testing included speakers and ear buds
* extensive functional testing of ear buds.

### for G5 Google phones 
* within the performance testing we had to include test cases that focused on audio and video to drain the battery
and see what the impact on power (battery) was.

### for Fitbit
