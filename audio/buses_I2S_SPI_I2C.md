## Serial communication protocols (found in embedded systems and audio devices)


### I2S
* Use for high-speed digital audio data transfer between codecs and audio processors.

### SPI
* Use for general-purpose communication with peripherals where speed is important and you have a limited number of devices.

### I2C
*  Use for low-speed control and configuration where you need to connect multiple devices using a minimal number of pins.

### Their purpose, key characteristics, and typical uses

**1. I2S (Inter-IC Sound)**

*   **Purpose:** Specifically designed for transmitting digital audio data between integrated circuits.  It's a high-speed, synchronous serial bus for audio.

*   **Key Characteristics:**

    *   **Synchronous:** Requires a clock signal to synchronize data transfer.
    *   **Serial:** Data is transmitted one bit at a time.
    *   **Three main lines:**
        *   **BCLK (Bit Clock or Serial Clock):** The clock signal that clocks each bit of the audio data. The frequency of BCLK depends on the sample rate and bit depth.
        *   **WS (Word Select or LRCLK or L/R Select):** Indicates which channel (left or right) is currently being transmitted (for stereo audio). Changes state at the beginning of each word.
        *   **SD (Serial Data or SDATA):** Carries the actual audio data.

    *   **Master/Slave:** One device is the master (typically providing the clocks) and the other is the slave. The specific master/slave roles can vary depending on the devices.
    *   **Point-to-Point:** Usually connects only two devices directly (e.g., a codec to a DSP, or a DAC to an amplifier).
    *   **Framing:** Data is typically transmitted in frames, with each frame containing audio data for both channels (left and right) in stereo.
    *   **No Addressing:** Because it's typically point-to-point, there's no need for device addressing.
    *   **Common Data Formats:** PCM (Pulse Code Modulation) is the most common audio data format.
    *   **MSB First:** Data is usually transmitted most significant bit (MSB) first.

*   **Typical Uses:**

    *   Connecting audio codecs (ADC/DAC) to audio processors (DSPs).
    *   Transferring audio data between a microcontroller or FPGA and an audio codec.
    *   Connecting digital audio amplifiers to audio sources.
    *   High-quality audio equipment.

*   **Advantages:**

    *   High speed suitable for audio data.
    *   Simple and well-defined protocol.
    *   Low overhead (minimal control signals).

*   **Disadvantages:**

    *   Point-to-point connection limits the number of devices that can be connected.
    *   No addressing means only one slave device can be connected to a master.
    *   Requires careful clock synchronization.

**2. SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)**

*   **Purpose:** A general-purpose synchronous serial communication protocol used for communication between microcontrollers and peripheral devices.

*   **Key Characteristics:**

    *   **Synchronous:** Requires a clock signal.
    *   **Serial:** Data is transmitted one bit at a time.
    *   **Four Main Lines (typically):**
        *   **MOSI (Master Out Slave In):** Data sent from the master to the slave.
        *   **MISO (Master In Slave Out):** Data sent from the slave to the master.
        *   **SCK (Serial Clock):** The clock signal generated by the master to synchronize data transfer.
        *   **SS (Slave Select) or CS (Chip Select):** A signal used by the master to select which slave device to communicate with.  Each slave has its own SS/CS line.

    *   **Master/Slave:** One device is the master, and one or more devices are slaves.
    *   **Full Duplex:** Can transmit and receive data simultaneously.
    *   **Addressing:** Slave selection is accomplished using individual SS/CS lines for each slave. The master asserts the SS/CS line for the desired slave.
    *   **Multiple Slaves:** Multiple slave devices can be connected to a single SPI master, but each slave needs its own SS/CS line.
    *   **Configurable Clock Polarity and Phase:** SPI has four different modes (CPOL, CPHA) that determine the clock polarity and phase, allowing it to work with a wide variety of devices.

*   **Typical Uses:**

    *   Communication with sensors (temperature, pressure, accelerometers).
    *   Interfacing with memory devices (EEPROMs, flash memory).
    *   Controlling display drivers.
    *   Communication with analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) and digital-to-analog converters (DACs).
    *   Interfacing with other microcontrollers or processors.

*   **Advantages:**

    *   Relatively high speed.
    *   Full-duplex communication.
    *   Simple protocol.
    *   Multiple slave devices can be connected.

*   **Disadvantages:**

    *   Requires more pins than I2C.
    *   No built-in addressing scheme (requires separate SS/CS lines for each slave).
    *   No acknowledgment mechanism.

**3. I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit)**

*   **Purpose:** A two-wire serial communication protocol used for low-speed communication between integrated circuits. It's primarily used for control and configuration rather than high-bandwidth data transfer.

*   **Key Characteristics:**

    *   **Synchronous:** Requires a clock signal.
    *   **Serial:** Data is transmitted one bit at a time.
    *   **Two Lines:**
        *   **SDA (Serial Data):** Carries the data.
        *   **SCL (Serial Clock):** The clock signal used for synchronization.

    *   **Multi-Master:** Multiple devices can act as a master, although typically only one master is active at a time.
    *   **Addressing:** Each device on the bus has a unique 7-bit or 10-bit address.
    *   **Open Drain:** SDA and SCL lines are open-drain, requiring pull-up resistors.
    *   **Acknowledgment:** The receiver acknowledges each byte of data that is received.
    *   **Arbitration:** A mechanism is used to resolve bus conflicts if multiple masters try to access the bus simultaneously.
    *   **Master/Slave:**  Devices can be masters or slaves. The master initiates the communication, and the slave responds.

*   **Typical Uses:**

    *   Controlling and configuring peripheral devices (sensors, RTCs, EEPROMs).
    *   Reading data from sensors.
    *   Interfacing with display drivers.
    *   Controlling power management circuits.
    *   Accessing configuration registers in other ICs (e.g., audio codecs, DSPs).

*   **Advantages:**

    *   Only requires two wires, minimizing pin count.
    *   Supports multiple master and slave devices.
    *   Built-in addressing scheme.
    *   Acknowledgment mechanism for error detection.

*   **Disadvantages:**

    *   Relatively slow compared to SPI and I2S.
    *   More complex protocol than SPI.
    *   Open-drain lines require pull-up resistors.
