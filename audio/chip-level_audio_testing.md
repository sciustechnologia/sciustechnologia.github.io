## Chip-level audio testing 


> validation and characterization performed directly on the chip package of an audio integrated circuit (IC). 
> This testing is crucial for ensuring the IC meets its design specifications and performs reliably in real-world audio applications. 
> It is significantly more granular and detailed than system-level testing.

## Breakdown of what chip-level audio testing entails

### 1. Test Objectives:

Verify functionality: 
*  Ensure that all audio blocks (ADC, DAC, amplifiers, filters, DSP cores, etc.) operate as intended according to the design specifications.

Performance parameters (measure the chipâ€™s audio performance): 
* Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) Meaning: the audio I want to hear (the signal) compared to how much unwanted background sound (the noise) is present. 
* Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise (THD+N)
* Dynamic Range (DR)
  * Frequency Response
  * Intermodulation Distortion (IMD)
  * Channel separation (Crosstalk)
  * Gain accuracy and linearity
  * Input and output impedance
  * Power consumption
  * Stability (avoiding oscillations)

Identify defects: 
* Detect any manufacturing defects, design flaws, or process variations that could affect audio performance.

Characterize process variations: 
* Understand how the chip's performance varies across different manufacturing lots, temperatures, and supply voltages. This data is used to set production test limits.

Ensure reliability: 
* Verify that the chip can withstand stress conditions (temperature, voltage, humidity) and maintain its performance over its intended lifespan.

Debug design: 
* Identify and fix design errors early in the development process.

### 2. Test Environment:

Automated Test Equipment (ATE): 
* Specialized test equipment designed for automated chip testing. 
* provide precise voltage sources, current meters, waveform generators, analyzers, and digital I/O. 
* programmable to run a suite of tests automatically.

Probe Card: 
* A custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) with fine needles (probes) that make temporary electrical contact with the IC's pads (bond pads) directly on the silicon wafer or packaged chip.

Load Board: 
* A PCB that provides the circuitry for connecting the ATE to the DUT (may include filters, amplifiers, level shifters, and other components to optimize the test setup).

Shielding: 
* Critical to minimize noise and interference in sensitive audio measurements. 

Temperature Control: 
* ATE systems often have temperature chambers to control the temperature of the DUT.
