## Chip-level audio testing 


> validation and characterization performed directly on the chip package of an audio integrated circuit (IC). 
> This testing is crucial for ensuring the IC meets its design specifications and performs reliably in real-world audio applications. 
> It is significantly more granular and detailed than system-level testing.

## Breakdown of what chip-level audio testing entails

### 1. Test Objectives:

Verify functionality: 
*  Ensure that all audio blocks (ADC, DAC, amplifiers, filters, DSP cores, etc.) operate as intended according to the design specifications.

Measure performance parameters: 
*  Thoroughly characterize the chip's audio performance, including:
  * Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
  * Total Harmonic Distortion + Noise (THD+N)
  * Dynamic Range (DR)
  * Frequency Response
  * Intermodulation Distortion (IMD)
  * Channel separation (Crosstalk)
  * Gain accuracy and linearity
  * Input and output impedance
  * Power consumption
  * Stability (avoiding oscillations)

Identify defects: 
* Detect any manufacturing defects, design flaws, or process variations that could affect audio performance.

Characterize process variations: 
* Understand how the chip's performance varies across different manufacturing lots, temperatures, and supply voltages. This data is used to set production test limits.

Ensure reliability: 
* Verify that the chip can withstand stress conditions (temperature, voltage, humidity) and maintain its performance over its intended lifespan.

Debug design: 
* Identify and fix design errors early in the development process.

### 2. Test Environment:

Automated Test Equipment (ATE): Specialized, high-precision test equipment designed for automated chip testing. ATE systems provide precise voltage sources, current meters, waveform generators, analyzers, and digital I/O. Crucially, they're programmable to run a suite of tests automatically.

Probe Card: A custom-designed printed circuit board (PCB) with fine needles (probes) that make temporary electrical contact with the IC's pads (bond pads) directly on the silicon wafer or packaged chip.

Load Board: A PCB that provides the necessary circuitry for connecting the ATE to the device under test (DUT). It may include filters, amplifiers, level shifters, and other components to optimize the test setup.

Shielding: Critical to minimize noise and interference in sensitive audio measurements. Test setups often use shielded enclosures, cables, and connectors.

Temperature Control: ATE systems often have temperature chambers to control the temperature of the DUT, allowing testing over a wide temperature range.
