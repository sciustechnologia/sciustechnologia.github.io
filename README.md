Over 10 years in the software quality assurance industry, 
I gained experience in testing and documenting. 
My process of sharing and conveying instructions, and suggestions logically and technically
was heavily based on the goal creating confidence. 
Confidence in technical writing is delivered by being committed to writing
  - clear 
  - concise, 
  - correct, and 
  - coherent (complete)

In my Playbooks, Handbooks, Userguides and 
other categories of documentations that 
delivered direction, instruction, or explanation I always tried to merge following perspectives:
- the logical sequence to get things done 
- the step by step approach that allows any user to accomplish goals
- readability, readability, readability. 

### Projects I was involved testing:
