def test_addition():
    assert 2 + 3 == 5
Use code with caution.
Python
Run Your Tests:
pytest
Use code with caution.
Bash
Pytest will automatically discover and run your tests.
Learn Fixtures:
Setup and teardown: Fixtures provide a way to set up resources (like database connections or files) before each test and clean them up afterward.

import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def my_data():
    return {"name": "Alice", "age": 30} 

def test_my_function(my_data):
    assert my_data["name"] == "Alice"
Use code with caution.
Python
Explore Parametrization:
Running tests with different inputs: Parametrize your tests to run them with multiple sets of data.
import pytest

@pytest.mark.parametrize("input, expected", [(2, 4), (5, 10), (-1, -2)])
def test_double(input, expected):
    assert input * 2 == expected
Use code with caution.
Python
Learn About Mocking:
Control external dependencies: Use mocking to replace external modules or functions with controlled behavior during tests.
from unittest.mock import patch
import my_module

@patch("my_module.external_api.get_data", return_value={"status": "success"})
def test_my_function(mock_get_data):
    # ... your test logic here ...
```
