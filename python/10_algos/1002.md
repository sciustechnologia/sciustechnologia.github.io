## Searching Algorithms:

### 1. Linear Search: 

* Simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a list until the target element is found or all elements are checked. Goes through each element sequentially.
* is straightforward but has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list. This means it may not be efficient for large datasets compared to more advanced search algorithms like Binary Search (O(log n)) which require the data to be sorted. However, it is useful when the list is not sorted or when a simple implementation is needed.
* Simple to implement, but inefficient for large datasets.
* Good for unsorted lists.

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform linear search to find the index of target in arr.
    Returns the index if found, otherwise returns -1.
    """
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [12, 45, 67, 23, 5, 17, 8]
target = 23
result = linear_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Target {target} found at index {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Target {target} not found in the array.")

# result: Target 23 found at index 3.

```
### Linear Search with a List

List Characteristics:
* Ordered collection of elements.
* Allows for duplicate elements.
* Supports indexing and iteration.

Why Use a List for Linear Search:
* Indexing: Lists in Python allow direct access to elements by their index. This makes it efficient to access elements sequentially during a linear search.
* Iteration: Lists support iteration using for loops, which is essential for scanning through each element to find the target.
* Ease of Implementation: Implementing a linear search in a list is straightforward and intuitive, utilizing basic indexing and looping constructs.

### Linear Search example with a List

Step 1: Function Definition: The linear_search function takes two parameters: arr (the list to be searched) and target (the element to search for).

Step 2: Iteration: The function iterates over each element in the list using a for loop. The range(len(arr)) generates indices from 0 to len(arr) - 1.

Step 3: Comparison: Inside the loop, the function compares the current element (arr[index]) with the target. If they are equal, the function returns the current index.

Step 4: Return Statement: If the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns -1, indicating that the target is not in the list.


```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    # Iterate through each element in the list
    for index in range(len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is equal to the target
        if arr[index] == target:
            # Return the index of the element if found
            return index
    # Return -1 if the target is not found in the list
    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
target = 30
result = linear_search(arr, target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}")
else:
    print(f"Element {target} not found in the list")
```

### Linear Search example with a Dictionary

```python
def linear_search_dict(d, target):
    # Iterate through each key-value pair in the dictionary
    for key, value in d.items():
        # Check if the current value is equal to the target
        if value == target:
            # Return the key of the element if found
            return key
    # Return None if the target is not found in the dictionary
    return None

# Example usage:
d = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40, 'e': 50}
target = 30
result = linear_search_dict(d, target)
if result is not None:
    print(f"Value {target} found with key '{result}'")
else:
    print(f"Value {target} not found in the dictionary")
```

Step 1: Function Definition: The linear_search_dict function takes two parameters: d (the dictionary to be searched) and target (the value to search for).

Step 2: Iteration: The function iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary using a for loop. The d.items() method returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's key-value tuple pairs.

Step 3: Comparison: Inside the loop, the function compares the current value (value) with the target. If they are equal, the function returns the corresponding key.

Step 4: Return Statement: If the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns None, indicating that the target is not in the dictionary.


### 2. Binary Search: 

* Efficient O(log n) search algorithm for sorted arrays/list that repeatedly divides the search interval in half.
* Divides the search space in half with each iteration.
* Much faster than linear search for sorted data.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Perform binary search to find the index of target in arr.
    Returns the index if found, otherwise returns -1.
    """
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # Check if target is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # If target is greater, ignore left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        # If target is smaller, ignore right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    # If we reach here, the target is not in the list
    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [5, 8, 12, 17, 23, 45, 67]
target = 23
result = binary_search(arr, target)

if result != -1:
    print(f"Target {target} found at index {result}.")
else:
    print(f"Target {target} not found in the array.")
```

### Binary Search with a List

Why Use a Sorted List for Binary Search:
* Efficiency: Binary search is significantly faster than linear search, with a time complexity of `O(log n)`, where n is the number of elements. This efficiency is achievable because binary search can quickly narrow down the search space by comparing the target value with the middle element of the list.
* Guaranteed Performance: Binary search relies on the property of sorted lists where elements are already ordered. This ensures that the algorithm can efficiently determine whether the target exists and where it might be located.
* Ease of Implementation: Implementing binary search in a sorted list is straightforward due to the ability to access elements by index and the ordered nature of the data.

### Binary Search example with a List

Step 1: Function Definition: The binary_search function takes two parameters: arr (the sorted list to be searched) and target (the element to search for).

Step 2: Initialization: Initialize two pointers, low and high, to represent the search range within the list. Initially, low is set to 0 and high is set to len(arr) - 1.

Step 3: While Loop: The loop continues as long as low is less than or equal to high.

Step 4: Middle Index: Calculate the middle index (mid) as the integer division of (low + high) // 2.

Step 5: Comparison:
* If the element at mid is equal to target, return mid (the index of the target element).
* If the element at mid is less than target, update low to mid + 1 to search in the right half of the list.
* If the element at mid is greater than target, update high to mid - 1 to search in the left half of the list.

Step 6: Return Statement: If the loop exits without finding the target, return -1 to indicate that the target is not in the list.

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    # Initialize the low and high pointers
    low = 0
    high = len(arr) - 1
    
    # While the search space is valid
    while low <= high:
        # Find the middle index
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        # Check if the target is at the mid index
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # If the target is greater than the mid element, ignore the left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        # If the target is less than the mid element, ignore the right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    # Return -1 if the target is not found
    return -1

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
target = 7
result = binary_search(arr, target)
if result != -1:
    print(f"Element {target} found at index {result}")
else:
    print(f"Element {target} not found in the list")
```

### Binary Search example with a Dictionary

- dictionaries in Python are not typically used for binary search because they are inherently unordered, we can simulate a binary search by sorting the dictionary keys and performing a binary search on the sorted keys. 

Step 1: 

```python
def binary_search_dict(d, target):
    # Get the sorted list of dictionary keys
    sorted_keys = sorted(d.keys())
    
    # Initialize the low and high pointers
    low = 0
    high = len(sorted_keys) - 1
    
    # While the search space is valid
    while low <= high:
        # Find the middle index
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        mid_key = sorted_keys[mid]
        
        # Check if the target value is at the mid index
        if d[mid_key] == target:
            return mid_key
        # If the target is greater than the mid element, ignore the left half
        elif d[mid_key] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        # If the target is less than the mid element, ignore the right half
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    # Return None if the target is not found
    return None

# Example usage:
d = {'a': 10, 'b': 20, 'c': 30, 'd': 40, 'e': 50}
target = 30
result = binary_search_dict(d, target)
if result is not None:
    print(f"Value {target} found with key '{result}'")
else:
    print(f"Value {target} not found in the dictionary")
```


### Hash Table Search:
* Uses a hash function to map keys to indices.
* Very fast for lookups, insertions, and deletions.
* Requires extra memory for the hash table.

### Tree Search:
* Utilizes tree data structures.
* Different types exist, including Binary Search Tree (BST), AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree.
* Provides efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.

### Graph Search:
* Explores nodes in a graph.
* Algorithms include Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
* Used for solving problems involving interconnected entities.
