## Bubble Sort w/ Dictionaries

- sort based on values.

```python
def bubble_sort_dict_by_value(dictionary):
    items = list(dictionary.items())
    # convert dictionary into a list of tuples
    n = len(items)

    # Traverse through all dictionary elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the dictionary from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the value of the current element is greater than the next element
            if items[j][1] > items[j+1][1]:
                items[j], items[j+1] = items[j+1], items[j]
    
    # Convert sorted items back to dictionary
    sorted_dict = dict(items)
    return sorted_dict

# Example
dictionary = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 7, 'date': 10, 'fig': 2}
print("Original dictionary:", dictionary)

sorted_dict = bubble_sort_dict_by_value(dictionary)

print("Sorted dictionary by value:", sorted_dict)

# OUTPUT
# Original dictionary: {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 7, 'date': 10, 'fig': 2}
# Sorted dictionary by value: {'fig': 2, 'banana': 3, 'apple': 5, 'cherry': 7, 'date': 10}
```

bubble_sort_dict_by_value(dictionary):
* This function performs bubble sort on a dictionary by its values.
* It converts the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value), sorts them based on values using bubble sort, and then converts them back into a dictionary.
* Bubble sort is applied similarly to how it is applied to lists, comparing adjacent elements based on their values.

### Bubble Sort based on keys.

```python
def bubble_sort_dict_by_keys(dictionary):
```
