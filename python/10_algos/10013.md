### 2 Selection Sort with list 

* Another O(n^2) sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array.

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    # takes an input list arr
    n = len(arr)
    # calculates the length of the list.

    # Traverse through all array elements; iterates over the entire list. 
    # Each iteration places the next smallest element at the correct position in the sorted subarray.

    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
         # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
         # initializes the minimum index to the current position of the outer loop.
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            # iterates through the unsorted part of the list to find the index of the smallest element.
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                # updates the minimum index if a smaller element is found.
                min_idx = j
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]

# Example
arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
selection_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

- outer loop for i in range(n) iterates through each element of the list.
- Inside the outer loop, we find the index of the minimum element (min_idx) in the unsorted portion of the list using the inner loop for j in range(i+1, n).
If we find an element smaller than the current minimum (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]), we update min_idx.
After finding the minimum element, we swap it with the first unsorted element (arr[i]) using arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i].
Step 1. Initialization:
* The algorithm starts at the beginning of the list.
* It maintains two subarrays: one that is already sorted and one that is unsorted.

Step 2. Finding the Minimum:
* In each iteration, the algorithm finds the minimum element from the unsorted subarray.

Step 3. Swapping:
* It swaps the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted subarray.
* After each iteration, the boundary between the sorted and unsorted subarrays moves one element to the right.

Step 4. Repeat:
* The process is repeated for the remaining unsorted part of the list until the whole list is sorted.
