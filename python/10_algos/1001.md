## Sorting Algorithms

* Bubble Sort
* Selection Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Shell Sort

### 1.1 Bubble Sort with lists
* Simple sorting algorithm.
* Each pair of adjacent elements is compared and the elements are swapped if they are not in order.
* Inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity.

```python
#bubblesort.py

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Traverse through all elements in the list
    for i in range(n):
        ''' 
        Last i elements are already in place, so we decrease the range
        outer loop:
        iterates over the entire list. After each complete iteration of the outer loop, 
        the largest element among the unsorted elements gets placed at the correct position.
        '''
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the array from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the element found is greater than the next element
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                # compares each pair of adjacent elements.
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                # swaps the elements if they are in the wrong order.

# Example:
arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
bubble_sort(arr)
print("Original array:", arr)

# OR
print("Sorted array:")
for i in range(len(arr)):
    print("%d" % arr[i])
```

### Steps
1. define a function bubble_sort that takes an input list arr.
2. n = len(arr) calculates the length of the list.
3. The outer loop for i in range(n) iterates through each element of the list.
4. The inner loop for j in range(0, n-i-1) performs pairwise comparisons and swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
5. After iterating through the entire list, the sorted array arr is printed out.

- sort the elements directly using their values.

Step 1. Initialization:
* The algorithm starts at the beginning of the list and iterates through the list multiple times.

Step 2. Comparison and Swap:
* For each pair of adjacent elements, compare them.
* If the element on the left is greater than the element on the right, swap them.

Step 3. Iterate through the List:
* Continue this process for each element in the list.
* After each full pass through the list, the largest element gets "bubbled" to the correct position.

Step 4. Repeat:
* Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted part of the list.
* Each pass through the list ensures that the next largest element is placed in its correct position.

Step 5. Optimization:
* If during a pass, no swaps are made, the list is already sorted, and the algorithm can terminate early.

### testing the code 
Assertions: Inside each test function, we use assert statements to check if the actual result matches the expected result.

* `test_bubble_sort_empty` tests the sorting of an empty list.
* `test_bubble_sort_sorted` tests the sorting of an already sorted list.
* `test_bubble_sort_unsorted` tests the sorting of a standard unsorted list.
* `test_bubble_sort_duplicates` tests the sorting of a list containing duplicates.

* To run the tests `pytest bubblesort.py`

```python
import pytest

def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:
                # compares each pair of adjacent elements.
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
                # swaps the elements if they are in the wrong order.

# Test cases
def test_bubble_sort_empty():
    arr = []
    bubble_sort(arr)
    assert arr == []

def test_bubble_sort_sorted():
    arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    bubble_sort(arr)
    assert arr == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

def test_bubble_sort_unsorted():
    arr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
    bubble_sort(arr)
    assert arr == [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]

def test_bubble_sort_duplicates():
    arr = [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
    bubble_sort(arr)
    assert arr == [5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
```


```python
def bubblesort(list):

# Swap the elements to arrange in order
   for iter_num in range(len(list)-1,0,-1):
    # Outer Loop 
      for idx in range(iter_num):
         if list[idx]>list[idx+1]:
            temp = list[idx]
            list[idx] = list[idx+1]
            list[idx+1] = temp
list = [19,2,31,45,6,11,121,27]
bubblesort(list)
print(list)
```

2. Outer Loop (for iter_num in range(len(list)-1,0,-1):):
len(list)-1: This calculates the last index of the list. The loop starts from this index.
0: This is the final value the loop will reach (we'll stop at the first element).
-1: This is the step size, indicating that the loop will iterate backward, decrementing the index by 1 in each iteration.
Explanation:
This outer loop controls the number of passes the algorithm will make. In each pass, the largest element in the unsorted portion of the list "bubbles" up to its correct position.
3. Inner Loop (for idx in range(iter_num):):
iter_num: The current index in the outer loop.
range(iter_num): This creates a range from 0 to the iter_num value (exclusive), effectively looping through elements in the current unsorted portion of the list.
Explanation:
This inner loop compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process of comparing and swapping repeats until the end of the unsorted portion is reached.
4. Comparison and Swapping (if list[idx]>list[idx+1]:):
list[idx] and list[idx+1]: These access the elements at the current index (idx) and the next index (idx+1) within the list.
if list[idx]>list[idx+1]:: This condition checks if the element at idx is greater than the element at idx+1. If true, it means the elements are in the wrong order.
5. Swapping Elements (temp = ...):
temp = list[idx]: A temporary variable temp is used to store the value of the element at idx.
list[idx] = list[idx+1]: The element at idx+1 is assigned to the position of idx.
list[idx+1] = temp: The value that was initially at idx (stored in temp) is assigned to the position of idx+1.

How the Code Works (Step-by-Step):
* list [19, 2, 31, 45, 6, 11, 121, 27].

### 1.2 Bubble Sort w/ Dictionaries

- sort based on values.

```python
def bubble_sort_dict_by_value(dictionary):
    items = list(dictionary.items())
    # convert dictionary into a list of tuples
    n = len(items)

    # Traverse through all dictionary elements
    for i in range(n):
        # Last i elements are already in place
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            # Traverse the dictionary from 0 to n-i-1
            # Swap if the value of the current element is greater than the next element
            if items[j][1] > items[j+1][1]:
                items[j], items[j+1] = items[j+1], items[j]
    
    # Convert sorted items back to dictionary
    sorted_dict = dict(items)
    return sorted_dict

# Example
dictionary = {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 7, 'date': 10, 'fig': 2}
print("Original dictionary:", dictionary)

sorted_dict = bubble_sort_dict_by_value(dictionary)

print("Sorted dictionary by value:", sorted_dict)

# OUTPUT
# Original dictionary: {'apple': 5, 'banana': 3, 'cherry': 7, 'date': 10, 'fig': 2}
# Sorted dictionary by value: {'fig': 2, 'banana': 3, 'apple': 5, 'cherry': 7, 'date': 10}
```

> items = list(dictionary.items()) - TypeError: 'list' object is not callable

bubble_sort_dict_by_value(dictionary):
* This function performs bubble sort on a dictionary by its values.
* It converts the dictionary into a list of tuples (key, value), sorts them based on values using bubble sort, and then converts them back into a dictionary.
* Bubble sort is applied similarly to how it is applied to lists, comparing adjacent elements based on their values.

1.2.1 Sort based on keys.
```python
def bubble_sort_dict_by_keys(dictionary):
```

---

### 2 Selection Sort with list 

* Another O(n^2) sorting algorithm that repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array.

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    # takes an input list arr
    n = len(arr)
    # calculates the length of the list.

    # Traverse through all array elements; iterates over the entire list. 
    # Each iteration places the next smallest element at the correct position in the sorted subarray.

    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
         # Find the minimum element in the remaining unsorted array
         # initializes the minimum index to the current position of the outer loop.
        for j in range(i+1, n):
            # iterates through the unsorted part of the list to find the index of the smallest element.
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:
                # updates the minimum index if a smaller element is found.
                min_idx = j
        # Swap the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted part
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]

# Example
arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
selection_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

- outer loop for i in range(n) iterates through each element of the list.
- Inside the outer loop, we find the index of the minimum element (min_idx) in the unsorted portion of the list using the inner loop for j in range(i+1, n).
If we find an element smaller than the current minimum (arr[j] < arr[min_idx]), we update min_idx.
After finding the minimum element, we swap it with the first unsorted element (arr[i]) using arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i].
Step 1. Initialization:
* The algorithm starts at the beginning of the list.
* It maintains two subarrays: one that is already sorted and one that is unsorted.

Step 2. Finding the Minimum:
* In each iteration, the algorithm finds the minimum element from the unsorted subarray.

Step 3. Swapping:
* It swaps the found minimum element with the first element of the unsorted subarray.
* After each iteration, the boundary between the sorted and unsorted subarrays moves one element to the right.

Step 4. Repeat:
* The process is repeated for the remaining unsorted part of the list until the whole list is sorted.

### 3 Insertion Sort with list 

- Builds the final sorted array one item at a time, O(n^2) but efficient for small datasets.

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    # Traverse through 1 to len(arr) elements
    # Iterate through each element in the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        
        # Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are greater than key, to one position ahead of their current position
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        # Place the key in its correct location
        arr[j + 1] = key

# Example
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]
insertion_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```


Step 1. 
* We define a function insertion_sort that takes an input list arr.

Step 2. 
* The outer loop for i in range(1, len(arr)) iterates through each element of the list, starting from the second element (arr[1]).
* Outer Loop: The algorithm iterates over each element in the array starting from the second element (i ranges from 1 to len(arr) - 1).

Step 3. 
* Inside the outer loop, key = arr[i] stores the current element to be compared and inserted into the sorted portion of the list.
* Key: For each iteration, it takes the current element (key = arr[i]) and compares it with the elements in the sorted part of the array (to the left of i).

Step 4. 
* The inner while loop while j >= 0 and key < arr[j] shifts elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key to one position ahead of their current position (arr[j + 1] = arr[j]).
* Inner Loop: It then moves the elements of the sorted part of the array that are greater than the key one position to the right, creating space for the key.

Step 5. 
* After finding the correct position for key, it is placed in its sorted position with arr[j + 1] = key.
* Placement: Once the correct position for the key is found, it is placed in that position.


### Walkthrough for the array [12, 11, 13, 5, 6]

```text
First iteration (i = 1):
Key = 11
Compare 11 with 12 (arr[0]), shift 12 to the right
Place 11 at arr[0]
Result: [11, 12, 13, 5, 6]

Second iteration (i = 2):
Key = 13
Compare 13 with 12 (arr[1]), no shift needed
Result: [11, 12, 13, 5, 6]

Third iteration (i = 3):
Key = 5
Compare 5 with 13 (arr[2]), shift 13 to the right
Compare 5 with 12 (arr[1]), shift 12 to the right
Compare 5 with 11 (arr[0]), shift 11 to the right
Place 5 at arr[0]
Result: [5, 11, 12, 13, 6]

Fourth iteration (i = 4):
Key = 6
Compare 6 with 13 (arr[3]), shift 13 to the right
Compare 6 with 12 (arr[2]), shift 12 to the right
Compare 6 with 11 (arr[1]), shift 11 to the right
Place 6 at arr[1]
Result: [5, 6, 11, 12, 13]
```

### 4. Merge Sort with list 

- `O(n log n)` 
- divide-and-conquer algorithm that divides the input array into two halves, recursively sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves to produce a sorted array.

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:
        
        # Finding the mid of the array
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        
        # Dividing the elements into 2 halves
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]
        
        # Recursive call on each half
        merge_sort(left_half)
        merge_sort(right_half)
        
        # Merge the two halves into sorted order
        i = j = k = 0
        
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        
        # Checking if any element was left
        while i < len(left_half):
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        
        while j < len(right_half):
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1

# Example usage:
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
merge_sort(arr)

print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

Step 1: We define a function merge_sort that takes an input list arr.

Step 2: The function first checks if the length of arr is greater than 1, indicating there are elements to sort.

Step 3: It calculates the middle index mid of the array and divides arr into two halves: left_half and right_half.

Step 4: The function recursively calls merge_sort on each half until the base case (single element or empty array) is reached.

Step 5: After sorting both halves, the merge function merges the two sorted halves back into the original array arr.

Step 6: The merge process compares elements from left_half and right_half, placing them in sorted order into arr.

### 5. Quick Sort: 

* `O(n log n)` 
* divide-and-conquer algorithm that uses a pivot element to partition the array into smaller sub-arrays.

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choosing the middle element as the pivot
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
    
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

# Example usage:
arr = [12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7]
sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)

print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

Step 1: We define a function quick_sort that takes an input list arr.
Step 2: If the length of arr is 1 or less, it simply returns arr (base case for recursion).
Step 3: he pivot element is chosen as arr[len(arr) // 2], which is the middle element in this implementation.
Step 4: We create three sub-lists (left, middle, and right) using list comprehensions:
* left contains elements less than the pivot.
* middle contains elements equal to the pivot.
* right contains elements greater than the pivot.
Step 5: We recursively apply quick_sort to left and right sub-lists and concatenate them along with the middle list to get the sorted array.

### 1.4 Quick Sort example on a List:

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    # Base case: if the list is empty or has one element, it is already sorted
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    else:
        # Select the pivot element (here, we choose the middle element)
        pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]
        
        # Partition the list into three parts: less than, equal to, and greater than the pivot
        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
        middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]
        
        # Recursively apply quick_sort to the left and right partitions, and concatenate the results
        return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)

# Example usage:
arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
sorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)
print("Sorted array:", sorted_arr)
```

Step 1: Base Case: If the list has zero or one element, it is already sorted, so we return it as is.

Step 2: Choosing a Pivot: We choose the middle element of the list as the pivot.

Step 3: Partitioning:
* Left: All elements less than the pivot.
* Middle: All elements equal to the pivot.
* Right: All elements greater than the pivot.

Step 4:  Recursion: Recursively apply the quick_sort function to the left and right sublists.

Step 5:  Concatenation: Combine the sorted left sublist, middle list, and sorted right sublist to get the final sorted list.

more efficient ways to choose a pivot and partition the list
*  improves performance by choosing a better pivot and performing partitioning in-place, which reduces the overall space complexity.

```python
def median_of_three(arr, low, high):
    mid = (low + high) // 2
    # Sorting the first, middle, and last elements to find the median
    if arr[low] > arr[mid]:
        arr[low], arr[mid] = arr[mid], arr[low]
    if arr[low] > arr[high]:
        arr[low], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[low]
    if arr[mid] > arr[high]:
        arr[mid], arr[high] = arr[high], arr[mid]
    return arr[mid]

def partition(arr, low, high):
    pivot = median_of_three(arr, low, high)
    i = low - 1
    j = high + 1
    while True:
        # Increment i while arr[i] < pivot
        i += 1
        while arr[i] < pivot:
            i += 1
        # Decrement j while arr[j] > pivot
        j -= 1
        while arr[j] > pivot:
            j -= 1
        # If two pointers met
        if i >= j:
            return j
        # Swap elements at i and j
        arr[i], arr[j] = arr[j], arr[i]

def quick_sort(arr, low, high):
    if low < high:
        # Partition the array and get the pivot index
        pivot_index = partition(arr, low, high)
        # Recursively apply quick_sort to the left and right partitions
        quick_sort(arr, low, pivot_index)
        quick_sort(arr, pivot_index + 1, high)

# Example usage:
arr = [3, 6, 8, 10, 1, 2, 1]
quick_sort(arr, 0, len(arr) - 1)
print("Sorted array:", arr)
```

Step 1: Median of Three: This function selects the median of the first, middle, and last elements of the array segment to use as the pivot. This helps to avoid worst-case scenarios like already sorted arrays.

Step 2: Partition Function:
* Pivot Selection: Uses the median of three to select the pivot.
* Pointer Movement: Two pointers, i and j, are used to scan the array from the left and right, respectively. They move towards each other until they find elements that are out of place relative to the pivot, then they swap these elements.
* Termination: The loop continues until the two pointers cross, at which point the function returns the index of the partition.

Step 3: Quick Sort Function:
Recursive Calls: Applies Quick Sort recursively to the left and right segments of the array divided by the partition index.
