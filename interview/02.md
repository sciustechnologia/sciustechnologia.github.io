## Testing Mobile Apps

>  on iOS (and Android - with focus on testing different types of functionalities)

     * E-commerce flows,
     * user interface

## I. Setting the Stage (Regardless of OS)

### Understanding Requirements:
* The absolute foundation. What's the app *supposed* to do?  
* sources: user stories, design documents, specifications, and conversations with developers/product owners.  
* Ambiguity kills testing efforts.

### Test Environment Setup:

1. Real Devices (essential).  
  * Implemented a range of devices with different screen sizes, OS versions (focus on the most popular and the minimum supported), and hardware specs.
  * Try a physical device lab (cloud-based, not so much first hand exprience with it). 
    * At Google we built racks, at Amazon the developers sent prototypes within a cluster. (Sometimes a project has only one prototype.) 
  * Emulators/Simulators (have not used on a regular basis):
  	* Useful for initial testing and automation development. 
  	* Android Studio's emulator for Android. 
  	* Xcode's simulator for iOS. 
  	
  	> Note: *never* rely solely on emulators; they don't perfectly replicate real-world device behavior.
  	
2. Network Conditions:
  	* Mimic different network speeds (Wi-Fi, 4G, 3G, Edge).
      * testing 5G phones (Google):
        * I didn't build the entire lab, 
        * monitoring the data and debugging, triaging the bug.
  	    * The developers used tools like Network Link Conditioner (macOS) or Android's Developer Options to throttle bandwidth and simulate packet loss.
  	
3. Background Apps:
  	* Run common background apps (music streaming, email, location services) to simulate real-world memory pressure and potential conflicts.
    * Test Data: Prepared realistic and comprehensive test data.  Used a small test database / API endpoint to avoid impacting production data.

### Test Plan:
* Outlining my testing strategy, scope, objectives, timelines, and resource allocation. Here my Agile Test plan [within my QA playbook](https://trumpfheller.github.io/playbook/03.html)
* With a feature that is already  on prod (upgrading an existing feature) you plan differently compared to a feature that is new & added.

## II. Key Testing Areas (Android & iOS, with Android Emphasis)

> breakdown by functionality, with considerations for both platforms but tailored more towards Android:
