### Agile Testing

ðŸ“Œ **Definition**: 
* Agile testing follows an **iterative development process**,
* integrating **continuous testing** into short **sprints** (1-2 weeks).
* Testing happens **in parallel with development** rather than at the end.

ðŸŽ¯ **My Expertise collaborating with developers in an Agile environment**

* Example: "At Google (Fitbit), I worked in an **Agile Scrum** team where testing was integrated into each sprint. I participated in daily stand-ups, worked closely with developers to automate regression tests using XCUITest, and helped refine user stories to include testability criteria."

âœ” **My role in sprint cycles and CI/CD testing (Plangrid/Autodesk)**

* Example: "As a QA lead, I ensured that all new features were tested within the sprint cycle using automated XCUITest scripts, executed in **Xcode Cloud** as part of our **CI/CD pipeline**."

âœ” **My early-stage testing & shift-left approach (Google, Amazon, Plangrid)**

* Example: "In Agile teams, I implemented a **Shift-Left testing** approach, where we wrote test cases alongside developers before coding began. This helped reduce defects and ensure testability from the start."

âœ” **Agile testing types (TDD, BDD, exploratory testing, regression automation)**

* Example: "I used **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber** to ensure test cases were written in human-readable language and aligned with business expectations."

âœ” **My collaboration with Product & Development teams**

* Example: "I actively participated in sprint planning, backlog grooming, and retrospectives to ensure test coverage for new features, such as Apple Pay integration in the Apple Store app."
