### Agile Testing

üìå **Definition**: 
* Agile testing follows an **iterative development process**,
* integrating **continuous testing** into short **sprints** (1-2 weeks).
* Testing happens **in parallel with development** rather than at the end.

üéØ **My expertise collaborating with developers in an Agile environment**

*  Google (Fitbit) Example: I worked in an **Agile Scrum** team where testing was integrated into each sprint. I participated in daily stand-ups, worked closely with developers to clean up regression tests, and helped refine testing criteria/requirement.
*  Plangrid (Autodesk) Example: I worked in an **Agile** team where testing was integrated into each sprint. I participated in daily stand-ups, worked closely with developers to automate API tests using Postman, and helped refine user stories to include testability criteria."

‚úî **My role in sprint cycles and CI/CD testing (Plangrid/Autodesk)**

* Plangrid (Autodesk) Example: "As a QA lead, I ensured that all new features were tested within the sprint cycle using automated Postman scripts, executed in **Jenkins** as part of our **CI/CD pipeline**."

‚úî **My early-stage testing & shift-left approach (Google, Amazon, Plangrid)**

* Example: "In Agile teams, I implemented a **Shift-Left testing** approach, where we wrote test cases alongside developers before coding began. This helped reduce defects and ensure testability from the start."

‚úî **Agile testing types (TDD, BDD, exploratory testing, regression automation)**

* Google (Assistant) Example: "I used **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber** to ensure test cases were written in human-readable language and aligned with business expectations."

‚úî **My collaboration with Product & Development teams**

* Example: "I actively participated in backlog grooming, and retrospectives to ensure test coverage for new and established features."

### Testing Types Relevant to Apple‚Äôs Mobile Apps/E-commerce

1Ô∏è‚É£ Functional Testing 
* Ensures each feature works as expected.
Example: Verifying "Add to Bag" correctly updates the cart.
Test Approaches:
* Unit Testing: XCTest for Swift-based API validation.
* UI Testing: XCUITest for UI workflows.
* Integration Testing: Checking backend (APIs) and frontend connections.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Regression Testing 
* Ensures new updates don‚Äôt break existing features.
Example: Running automated XCUITest scripts after adding a new payment method.
Key Areas: Login, Checkout, Search, Cart, (Amazon: Wishlist), Payment Processing.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Testing 
* Measures app speed, responsiveness, and stability under different conditions.
Example: Checking how the Apple Store app handles high user traffic during iPhone pre-orders.
Tools: Instruments (Xcode), XCTest, Firebase Performance Monitoring.
Key Metrics:
* Launch Time (App should open within 2s).
* Response Time (API calls < 200ms).
* Battery Consumption & Memory Usage.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Usability Testing 
* Ensures the app is intuitive, accessible, and user-friendly.
Example: Testing the checkout flow for one-handed use, VoiceOver accessibility.
Key Areas:
* Navigation & UI Consistency (Does "Add to Bag" button look tappable?).
* Text Readability (Dynamic Type support).
* Error Handling (Clear error messages, retry options).

5Ô∏è‚É£ Compatibility Testing 
* Ensures the app works across all iPhone, iPad, and macOS devices.
Example: Testing Apple Store app on iPhone SE, iPhone Pro Max, iPad Pro.
Key Areas:
* Screen sizes,
* iOS versions,
* dark mode,
* accessibility features.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Localization Testing 
* Verifies language translations, currency formats, date/time formats.
Example: Checking if French and Japanese translations display correctly.
Key Areas: 
* RTL support,
* currency conversions,
* region-specific offers.

### Functional Testing:

Unit Testing:
Focuses on testing individual components or units of code in isolation. ¬† 

Integration Testing:
Verifies that different units or modules of the application work together correctly. ¬† 

System Testing:
Evaluates the complete, integrated system to ensure it meets specified requirements. ¬† 

End-to-End Testing:
Tests the application's workflow from beginning to end, simulating real-user scenarios. ¬† 
Acceptance Testing (User Acceptance Testing - UAT):
Determines whether the application meets the end-user's needs and business requirements. ¬† 
Functional Testing: done a lot
Unit Testing: just for me privately
Integration Testing: some
System Testing: not really except with Oculus 3.
Evaluates the complete, integrated system to ensure it meets specified requirements. ¬† 
End-to-End Testing:
Done - a lot
Acceptance Testing (User Acceptance Testing - UAT):
Done - a lot

Non-Functional Testing:

### Performance Testing:
Evaluates the application's speed, stability, and responsiveness under various workloads. ¬† 
Includes:
Load Testing: Assessing performance under expected user loads. ¬† 
Stress Testing: Testing beyond normal capacity to find breaking points. ¬† 
Scalability Testing: Evaluating the application's ability to handle increasing workloads. ¬† 
Security Testing:
Identifies vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application's security. ¬† 
Usability Testing:
Evaluates the ease of use and user-friendliness of the application. ¬† 
Compatibility Testing:
Ensures the application works correctly across different browsers, operating systems, and devices. ¬† 
Accessibility Testing:
Ensures that applications are usable by people with disabilities. ¬† 
Other Important Testing Types:

Performance Testing:

Includes:
Stress Testing: 
Scalability Testing: 
Usability Testing:
Compatibility Testing:
Accessibility Testing:


### Regression Testing:
Verifies that new code changes do not negatively impact existing functionality. ¬† 
### Smoke Testing:
Performs a quick check of the application's core functionality to ensure it is stable enough for further testing. ¬† 
Sanity Testing:
Performed after bug fixes, to ensure that the fixes worked, and that no new issues were introduced. ¬† 
Black-Box Testing:
Testing without knowledge of the application's internal code. ¬† 
White-Box Testing:
Testing with knowledge of the application's internal code.
Gray-Box Testing:
A combination of black box and white box testing.
