## Battery chemistry  

### 1. Battery Types and Chemistries:
* Lithium-ion (Li-ion): The most common type, understanding their variations is crucial.
  * Lithium Cobalt Oxide (LiCoO2): High energy density, but prone to overheating.
  * Lithium Manganese Oxide (LiMn2O4): Good safety profile, but lower energy density.
  * Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide (NMC): Widely used in EVs, offering good balance of performance and safety.
  * Lithium Iron Phosphate (LiFePO4): Excellent safety, long cycle life, but lower energy density.
* Lead-Acid: Widely used in cars, cheap, but heavy and low energy density.
* Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd): High cycle life, but toxic and poor energy density.
* Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH): Higher energy density than NiCd, but lower cycle life.
* Flow Batteries: For large-scale energy storage, using liquid electrolytes.
