## Breakdown of VR/AR/MR framework and application testing

### 1. Unique Challenges

### 1.1. Immersion & Interactivity
> testing AR/VR/MR experiences requires a different approach than traditional software testing => importance of testing for
* seamless immersion,
* intuitive interactions, and
* realistic environments.

### 1.2. Sensor & Device Compatibility 
> tested across multiple VR headsets, AR glasses, and MR devices, understanding the varying capabilities and potential for compatibility issues.

### 1.3. Motion Sickness & User Fatigue
> conduct testing to identify and mitigate
* motion sickness,
* ensuring user comfort and
* preventing fatigue during extended sessions.

### 1.4. Performance 
> conduct performance testing to analyze/optimize experiences for smooth and responsive interactions.

  | Device | Refresh Rates |
  |--|--|
  | Meta Quest | 60 Hz, 72 Hz |
  | Meta Quest 2 | 60 Hz, 72 Hz, 80 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz |
  | Meta Quest 3 | 72 Hz, 80 Hz, 90 Hz, 120 Hz |
  | Meta Quest Pro | 72 Hz, 90 Hz |
  | Oculus Rift | 90 Hz |
  | Oculus Rift S | 80 Hz |

* latency, and
* resource utilization 

### 2. Showcase Specific Frameworks & Tools

2.1. Unity & Unreal Engine 
* using both Unity and Unreal Engine for AR/VR/MR development and testing. 
* navigating the testing tools within these environments, such as
    * profiling tools,
    * scene management, and
    * debugging utilities.

2.2. ARKit, ARCore, & XR SDKs 
* cross-platform capabilities of the XR SDKs for developing immersive experiences.
* using ARKit and ARCore for mobile AR applications, 

2.3. Testing Platforms 
* tested platforms like Oculus Quest and developed understanding the specific functionalities and limitations of the platform.

2.4. Simulation & Emulation 
* utilized simulation tools and emulators to test AR/VR experiences in a controlled environment, allowing for early identification and resolution of potential issues.

### 3. Testing Process & Methodology

3.1. User-Centered Approach 
* My testing philosophy emphasizes
  * a user-centered approach,
  * conducting usability tests with real users to gather feedback on the overall experience and identify areas for improvement (or simply keep an eye on related forums).

3.2. Functional & Non-Functional Testing 
> covering areas like
* user interface,
* navigation,
* input mechanisms,
* performance,
* stability, and
* accessibility.

3.3. Bug Tracking & Reporting 
* providing detailed reports to the development team, including steps to reproduce issues and providing context for effective resolutions (logs, adb bugreports, screenshots).
