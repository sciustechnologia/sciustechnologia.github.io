## My QA Playbook

_yay_

[back](./)

My playbook is a documentation of testing workflow and 
in part an attempt to create a set of suggestions 
(An instruction book put together by me) 
that are considered to be suitable for QA.


Phase 1: Initiate Project
Understand the requirements  
* Product manager; release date, knowledge transfer
* Research tooling
* Define a quality strategy

At kickoff the tester will receive information about the project that is about to launch. 

To assess what's important, ehese questions will help you gather relevant information: 
* why does this project matter? 
* what does success look like, (MVP)?
* what is the overall task that this project is answering 
* identify the people who possess project knowledge and have power to influence change, the project's stakeholders (meet with the team to learn details about the project).
 
If you are working with existing software try to determine 
* what knowledge the overall team possesses 
* understand the pain points of building a new system in tandem with the old. 

If you're building a new piece of software consider 
* what knowledge and understanding can be gathered before the team begins to build. 


Phase 2: Planning and set up 
* Set milestones
* Deliverables (team alignment) 
* Identify risks
* work agreement
* Definition of Done  (DoD includes usually Agile Testing, Manual Testing, Automation Testing)

Phase 3: Testing
* Testcases >> Test Plan >> Test Cycles
* 

Phase 4: Release
* 

Phase 5: Evaluation 
* how to improve going forward
