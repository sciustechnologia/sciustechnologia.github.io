description: QA testing and technical writing
---
Over 10 years in the software quality assurance industry,
I gained experience in testing and documenting.
My process of sharing and conveying instructions, and suggestions logically and technically
was heavily based on the goal creating confidence.

### Projects I was involved testing:

1 Google Assistent (e2e) testing

#### Technical Writing was in each of my projects driven by the need for clarity.
#### and clarity through technical writing creates confidence.

### The for 4Cs:
- clear
- concise,
- correct, and
- coherent (complete)

In my Playbooks, Handbooks, Userguides and
other categories of documentations that
delivered direction, instruction, or explanation I always tried to merge following perspectives:
- the logical sequence to get things done
- the step by step approach that allows any user to accomplish goals
- readability, readability, readability.
