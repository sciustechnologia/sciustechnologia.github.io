Over 10 years in the software quality assurance industry,
I gained experience in testing and documenting.

### Projects I was involved testing:

I use in my Playbooks, Handbooks, and Userguides following perspectives as guideline:
  1) the logical sequence to get things done.
  2) the step by step approach that allows any user to accomplish goals.
  3) readability, readability, readability!
